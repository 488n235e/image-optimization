## Image Optimization

Images are usually the heaviest components of a web page, both in terms of bytes and number of HTTP requests. Optimizing images on your website is critical to improve your users’ experience, reduce delivery costs and enhance your position in search engine ranking. For example, Google’s Largest Contentful Paint metric in their search ranking algorithm is highly impacted by how much you optimize the images on your website. In the solution, we provide you with a simple and performant solution for image optimization using serverless components such as Amazon CloudFront, Amazon S3 and AWS Lambda.
